# AngOFA: LEVERAGING OFA EMBEDDING INITIALIZATION AND SYNTHETIC DATA FOR ANGOLAN LANGUAGE MODEL

We provide code implementations for both ANGOFA and ANGXLM-R models, along with resources for embedding initialization and continued pretraining. Additionally, Hugging Face models for both ANGOFA and ANGXLM-R are available on the model hub for easy access and experimentation.

## Folder Structure
- **Embedding_Initialization**: Folder containing materials related to embedding initialization.
- **Continued_Pretraining**: Folder containing materials related to continued pretraining.
- **code**: Folder containing the code for both ANGOFA and ANGXLM-R models.
  - **AngOFA**: Folder containing code related to the ANGOFA model.
  - **ANGXLM-R**: Folder containing code related to the ANGXLM-R model.

## Hugging Face Models
Both ANGOFA and ANGXLM-R models are available on Hugging Face's model hub for easy access and experimentation.
