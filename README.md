## [ANGOFA: Leveraging OFA Embedding Initialization and Synthetic Data for Angolan Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02534)

üöÄ Welcome to the repository for ANGOFA, a project aimed at developing tailored pre-trained language models specifically fine-tuned for Angolan languages using a combination of OFA embedding initialization and synthetic data.

## Overview: 

In recent years, the development of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has showcased their capacity to transcend linguistic barriers and facilitate knowledge transfer across diverse languages. However, very-low resource languages like those spoken in Angola have been largely overlooked, creating a void in the multilingual landscape. ANGOFA addresses this gap by introducing four PLMs fine-tuned specifically for Angolan languages.

## Key Features: 
- üåç Multilingual Adaptation: Tailored PLMs fine-tuned for Angolan languages using Multilingual Adaptive Fine-tuning (MAFT) approach
- üìö Enhanced Performance: Surveying the role of informed embedding initialization and synthetic data in improving PLM performance in downstream tasks.
- ‚ú® Variants: Includes ANGXLMR and ANGOFA variants, each with distinct fine-tuning processes and configurations.


## Hugging Face Models ü§ó
